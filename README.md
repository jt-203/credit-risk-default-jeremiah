# Credit Risk Default Modeling & Dashboard  
**By Jeremiah Tshinyama**

This project analyzes credit risk for personal loans using historical data and machine learning. It trains models to predict default probability at origination and provides an interactive dashboard to explore risk factors and lending decision outcomes.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Credit risk is a core concern for lenders — understanding which borrowers are more likely to default helps protect capital and manage loan portfolios.  
This project:

- Processes real loan data
- Trains predictive models
- Evaluates performance using ROC-AUC and other metrics
- Shows results in an interactive Streamlit dashboard
